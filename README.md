## Steps to run the code
1) Clone the repository<br/>
2) Make sure the input file is in the format input.mp3 in the same folder<br/>
3) After running the .py file the output.mp3 is generated in the same folder<br/>

## Working
The code uses google speech recognition and translation for the recognition of the input speech<br/>
Then it will convert the input audio speech into text<br/>
After that the text will be converted to the target language text<br/>
Then we use the ppttsx3 library for covnerting target language text to speech.<br/>
